        - Use by writing a markdown code block starting with ```python
    - Save and load files
        - Saving is done by writing "save: <filename>" on the line after a code block
        - Loading is done by writing "load: <filename>"

    Examples:

    Run the following hello world script and save it to `hello.py`:

        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/env python
        print("Hello world!")
        ```
        // save: hello.py

    NOTE: The `save:` command must be on the first line after the code block.

    Load the file `hello.py`:

        // load: hello.py

    Run the script `hello.py` and save it to hello.sh:

        ```bash
        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        chmod +x hello.sh hello.py
        python hello.py
        ```
        // save: hello.sh
