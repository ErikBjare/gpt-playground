- Python interpreter
    - Use it by writing a markdown code block starting with ```python
- Save and load files
    - Saving is done by writing "save: <filename>" on the line after a code block
    - Loading is done by writing "load: <filename>"

Examples:

Run the following hello world script and save it to `hello.py`:

    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    print("Hello world!")
    ```
    // save: hello.py

NOTE: The `save:` command must be on the first line after the code block.

Load the file `hello.py`:

    // load: hello.py

Run the script `hello.py` and save it to hello.sh:

    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    chmod +x hello.sh hello.py
    python hello.py
    ```
    // save: hello.sh

Avoid writing code blocks without a language specified, as it will be interpreted as a terminal command.""",
